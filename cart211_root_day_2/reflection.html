  <p>Read Vannevar Bush, "As We May Think," Atlantic Monthly</p>
  <p>In the article "As We May Think" by Vannevar Bush, he urges that instruments should be invented and perfected for they would facilitate inherited knowledge of the ages</p>

Of what lasting benefit has been man's use of science and of the new instruments which his research brought into existence?
First, they have increased his control of his material environment.
secondly, Science has provided the swiftest communication between individuals, and wide communication would reach broader audience "

as research extends, the search for new instruments to imorove efficiency has increased. "Professionally our methods of transmitting and reviewing the results of research are generations old and by now are totally inadequate for their purpose"
 for example, investigators often staggered by abundant findings and conclusions

 "publication has been extended far beyond our present ability to make real use of the record."

 there are plenty of mechanical aids with which to effect a transformation in scientific records.

 A record if it is to be useful to science, must be continuously extended, it must be stored, and above all it must be consulted.

 It would be a brave man who would predict that such a process will always remain clumsy, slow, and faulty in detail. tele

 repetitive in nature and hence a fit matter to be relegated to the machine
 It is readily possible to construct a machine which will manipulate premises in accordance with formal logic, simply by the clever use of relay circuits.

 Logic can become enormously difficult, and it would undoubtedly be well to produce more assurance in its use.

 Selection devices speeds up the process if increased speed were economically warranted

  memex is a device in which an individual stores all his books, records, and communications, and which is mechanized so that it may be consulted with exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an enlarged intimate supplement to his memory.
